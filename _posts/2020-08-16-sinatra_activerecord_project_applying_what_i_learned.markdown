After barely managing to pass the CLI project, I felt that I learned a lot of things when it came to coding. Especially, this is attributed to learning that being able to use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is crucial to making applications understandable and acceptable in the programming world. They make your application more DRY, by utilizing objects in a harmonious fashion that allows the user or programmer to have a simple, easy-to-use experience when using the application. This is extremely important in the programming world, because applications are meant to be interactive and easy to use for others.

During the Sinatra ActiveRecord CRUD Project, with much more understanding of how to apply the concept of OOP in a coded application, I managed to make my program understand the objects that I am using to make the concept of my application a reality. The development of this project was much quicker and smoother than my CLI project. Of course, I was still scrappy and making many mistakes. But, troubleshooting and finding the solution to those mistakes were much easier, perhaps to due to the gained experience of coding and by applying more of what I learned through OOP and associating my objects. I did not have to completely change my project idea this time! Whenever there was a mistake, there was always a path to find a solution because not only did I not overcomplicate my project with following requirements (which contributed to the difficulty of the CLI project), but I always found a way to ask myself "how" I could use my object and how I can apply it.

Another approach that I changed that helped contribute to the smooth success of my scrappy troubleshooting, was applying what Iearned from the labs. I looked at several of my previous labs to see how the labs' applications worked, and used them as recommendations to test out in my project code. This signifcantly helped my progress by showing me what works and what does not work in a Sinatra ActiveRecord CRUD application. The more labs I reread through and relearned from, the more I imprinted the knowledge and tools in my memory to fix and improve my project.

Overall, this project was an enjoyable experience because I had more experience! I learned that the more you understand your code and understand how to find the direction for debugging it, the more smoothly the development of the application goes. At the same time, coding becomes more fun and gives you more passion to code!
