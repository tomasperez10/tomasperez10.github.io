After working on the Rails portfolio project, I learned further about the importance of habits in coding. Throughout the program, I thought it was ideal to get the code written out before trying to run the application. However, when projects get more complex like in the case of the Rails project, this bad habit comes into play more. I ended up spending more time figuring out how to correct my mistakes that did not allow my code to work than writing out code alone. In fact, it took me very long to figure out how to even get my server to run in the first place, let alone correcting the code that was not working.

Although I ended up learning the hard way on making progress with my project, I'm very happy to have learned more about my bad habits in coding so that in the long run I do not have to stress as much about it once I stop that habit. I also avoid asking for help many times although my instructor is more than happy to go out of his way to help. In the end, I learned that what's most important in the journey of a software engineer is not from his knowledge alone on the code, but from the frequent usage of trial and error along the way with the teamwork that he/she has available.
