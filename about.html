<p>Graduating from Atlanta International School, and majoring in Economics with a minor in Psychology from University of Miami, I was still unsure about what I wanted to do with my career. Economics and Psychology were what I thought to be interesting subjects that I could see myself partaking in a career in, but as I grew and gained more knowledge, I just could not find the "why" to my reasoning. I simply did not have enough passion for those fields to strive to get better and search for jobs related to them. As a result, I thought it was time to try something new and see if I can find that effect that truly gauges my interest and makes me want to interact with it consistently. And that's where software engineering comes in. I realized that my main passion was video games, whether competitive or casual. My little brother, who is a Computer Science major at Brown University, has showed me some of his game engines that he has created from what he has learned from his field. This gave me the idea that creating video games can be a great career to pursue for, a field that not only pays well, but also brings a newfound appreciation of the beauty and complexity of the code that enables us to play video games. So, I start off teaching myself HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL among other languages and start to see how interesting the field of software engineering is. A field that is interactive, innovative, adaptive, coming in different forms and styles (languages), gives a variety of interesting career options besides just the video game industry, and crucial in our daily lives. As I got more and more experience coding, I decided to apply to a well-regarded coding bootcamp, Flatiron School, to make this experience proven on paper to kickstart my career in software engineering. I started learning another language, Ruby, and gained even more interest due to the great structure and teaching style of this bootcamp. The pre-course basically "coded" the fundamentals of coding into my brain, and many other things that seemed too complicated for me to understand. It simplified the complicated by using those fundamentals and teaching me step by step. The pre-course was not easy, in fact many labs were very difficult, but the structure gave me a great foundation to learn code that helped me get through the scary application process and get accepted into Flatiron School, although with the teaching and resources the application process was no longer scary to me. As I have moved on through my first two weeks in the course, I am more than happy with my decision to study software engineering.</p>
