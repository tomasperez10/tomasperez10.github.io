<p>Hello, my name is Tomas Perez. I was born in San Francisco with a Spanish father and an African American mother. I have two younger brothers. I moved to Baltimore, Maryland at age 3, and then moved to Atlanta, Georgia at age 7 and have lived there since then. I played a lot of soccer until a bad injury to my knee, but also enjoy video games and spontaneous adventures with friends. I graduated from the University of Miami with a major in Economics and a minor in Psychology. Fun fact: when I was living in San Francisco (and I was a baby), I slept through an earthquake!</p>
